    We have three arrays:
        a. Difficulty[i] is the difficulty of the ith problem
        b. Marks[i] is the Marks of the ith problem.
        c. Student[i] is the ability of the ith student.
    The task is to figure out the maximum marks based on studentâ€™s ability. Make use of
    pointers for traversing the values in array.
    Note:
    The student can only complete a problem with difficulty at most [i].
    Every student can be assigned at most one problem, but one problem can be completed
    multiple times.
    For example, if 5 students attempt the same question of 10 mark, then the total marks will
    be 30. If a student can not attempt any problem, his/her mark is 0.
    Testcase 1
    Input:
    difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], marks = [10,20,30,40,50], student = [4,5,6,7]
    Output:
    100
    Explanation: Students are assigned problems of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get marks of
    [20,20,30,30] separately.
